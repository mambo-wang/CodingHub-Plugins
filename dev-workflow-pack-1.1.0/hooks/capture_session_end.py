"""CodeBuddy session hook wrapper for team-memory fusion (T6).

This is the **source** copy of the hook wrapper, shipped inside the ``codewiki``
package. When a user enables the team-memory capture hook in their own project,
the ``team-memory-hook`` MCP prompt copies this file into that project's
``.codebuddy/hooks/capture_session_end.py``. It is NOT invoked from inside the
package — CodeBuddy runs the *copied* file, which lives at
``<repo>/.codebuddy/hooks/capture_session_end.py``.

Registered in ``.codebuddy/settings.json`` for the ``SessionEnd`` event, which
points at the copied script:

  - ``SessionEnd``  (matcher "other", the only reason currently supported):
    the session is over — final, complete transcript. This is the only event
    that reliably carries a ``transcript_path``, so it is the sole capture
    trigger. PreCompact/Stop do not provide a transcript and only produced
    duplicate no-op envelopes, so they were removed.

CodeBuddy invokes the copied script (absolute path) and passes the event as
JSON on **stdin**, e.g. for SessionEnd:

    {
      "session_id": "...",
      "transcript_path": "/path/to/transcript.txt",   # conversation transcript
      "cwd": "/project/path",
      "hook_event_name": "SessionEnd",
      "reason": "other"
    }

SessionEnd carries ``session_id`` + ``transcript_path``, which is all the
capture path needs.

The copied wrapper resolves the repo path and the conversation transcript, then
delegates to ``codewiki.mcp._ide_hook`` (the capture-only sink) via a
subprocess so the codewiki package is imported with the repo on sys.path.

Requirements: the ``codewiki`` package must be importable by the copied hook's
python — either pip-installed, the hook lives inside a CodeWiki source
checkout, or ``$CODEWIKI_HOME`` points at one. Otherwise the wrapper returns
an actionable systemMessage and skips capture (it never blocks the IDE).

It deliberately does NOT distill — distillation is a separate background job.

Async / fire-and-forget: the wrapper launches ``codewiki.mcp._ide_hook`` as a
**detached background process** and returns immediately. The IDE never waits
for capture to finish (capture is cheap, but a very long transcript plus a
large ``repowiki/raw/`` backlog could otherwise approach the old 60s cap). The
child process owns cleanup of the temp event file (via the
``CODEWIKI_HOOK_EVENT_FILE`` env var) and still has its own internal try/except
so a failure never surfaces to the IDE.

Stdout is emitted in the CodeBuddy-expected ``{continue, systemMessage}`` shape.

    Returns ``(env, error)``. ``env`` extends ``os.environ`` (adding
    ``$CODEWIKI_HOME`` to PYTHONPATH when that fallback is used); ``error`` is
    a human-actionable message when no import path exists.

    Importability order (mirrors how ``python -m codewiki.mcp._ide_hook``
    resolves when run with cwd=REPO):
      1. ``codewiki`` installed in this interpreter (pip) — find_spec sees it.
      2. This hook lives inside a CodeWiki source checkout (``REPO/codewiki/``
         exists) — the subprocess runs with cwd=REPO, and ``-m`` puts cwd on
         sys.path, so the local package is importable without installation.
      3. ``$CODEWIKI_HOME`` points at a CodeWiki source checkout — the hook was
         copied into another project, so we add the checkout to PYTHONPATH.

    Without one of these the inner ``python -m`` would fail with an unhelpful
    ModuleNotFoundError buried in systemMessage; detect it up front instead.
